# CentralDogmaSimulation
Central dogma of molecular biology simulation. Transcribes DNA to RNA and translates RNA to protein. 
<br>

The following repository contains a python file created using Jupyter Notebook. The objective of this project is to simulate the central dogma of molecular biology (the flow of genetic information within a biological system: DNA -> RNA -> Protein) using protein DNA sequences from NCBI GenBank.
